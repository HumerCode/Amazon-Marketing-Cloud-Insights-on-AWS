For details refer https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html\n",

    "Use custom Expression if there is no hard requirement for a workflow to run at specific time. For e.g, custom(D * 14) means workflow will be scheduled to run Daily at sometime between 14:00 and 14:59 UTC, custom(W 2 8) means it will be scheduled to run Weekly on every 2nd day of the week at sometime between 08:00 and 08:59 UTC, custom(H * *) will schedule it to run every hour.\n",
