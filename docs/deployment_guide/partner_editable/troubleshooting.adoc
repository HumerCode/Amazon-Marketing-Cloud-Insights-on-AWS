*Q:* What is AWS DDK?

*A:* The AWS DataOps Development Kit is an open source development framework for customers that build data workflows and modern data architecture on AWS. For more information on this open source framework, reference the documentation [here](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-ddk/).


*Q:* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error in CloudFormation when I deployed the Quick Start.

*A:* Make sure you have bootstrapped the AWS Account(s) in use by running the command:

`ddk bootstrap --profile [AWS_PROFILE] --trusted-accounts [AWS_ACCOUNT_ID]`

Also, ensure the `ddk.json` file specifies the correct AWS Account ID for the child environment used to deploy (e.g. default is `dev`).

For additional information, see [Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html).


*Q:* I encountered a *FAILED* status on the *Assets* Step of the AWS CodePipeline Deployment.

*A:* If deploying in a new AWS Account, the Assets stage of the CodePipeline may fail due to limitations for the number of concurrent file assets to publish. This is a current limitation of AWS CodeBuild. To fix, click the `Retry` button in CodePipeline for the Assets Stage. This will manually continue the Assets Stage to continue building file assets from its most current progress.
